One of my other hobbies is woodworking, and I've been taking some time in this nice weather to build a new coffee table as a late Christmas present to my wife. I'm pretty proud of my work on it, it's teaching me some skills that are valuable in software development, and you can keep an eye out for a blog post on that! Here's my progress on this build so far:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ur5u51trpnk2ugquizpj.png\" alt=\"Design in SketchUp\" /><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/z0r4l8l1xbu9ddj82gmt.jpg\" alt=\"Tabletop in Progress\" /><\/p>\n<p>But despite that, I'm also making some great progress toward the next major release, 0.17.0! This will be a significant refactoring and improvement of the wiki and deployment features in Orchid to allow better integrations with all the major Git hosting platforms and pave the way for easier integration of similar features in the future.<\/p>\n<p>It's a pretty significant change and is taking a lot of work, but I have a goal of finally getting it out this month! Here's the full list of features that you can expect in this release:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Netlify deploys optimized for really large sites, and able to upload <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/\">serverless Functions<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Deploy site to GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or Azure DevOps (currently, only GitHub is supported)<\/li>\n<li>Import wiki content directly from GitHub Wikis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Are you interested in getting started with Orchid?

Pebble templates are now more descriptive about errors with\nbetter line-number tracking (to aid in resolving specific Pebble template issues), and <code>orchid-test<\/code> now only shows\nHTML selectors from the test instead of the entire rendered page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 id=\"in-progress\"><a href=\"#in-progress\" id=\"in-progress\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>In Progress<\/h1>\n<p>Continued work is underway to support relative URLs (for viewing an Orchid site without needing a local fileserver). In\naddition, Orchid's resource/file management is a core subsystem that would do well to be a separate library, and work is\nin progress to move it out of Orchid and into Arcana, it's own library.

And questions from y'all on how to use it have increased to match, and I'm so excited to be able to help solve your problems with Orchid!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pk0bsb0byg2d857xetng.png\" alt=\"March downloads\" /><\/p>\n<p>All of these statistics are freely available on Bintray, <a href=\"https://bintray.com/beta/#/orchidhq/orchid/orchid-core?tab=statistics\">go here<\/a> to check it out for yourself.<\/p>\n<h1 id=\"whats-new\"><a href=\"#whats-new\" id=\"whats-new\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>What's New?<\/h1>\n<p>Orchid is currently at version <a href=\"https://github.com/orchidhq/orchid/releases/tag/0.16.7\">0.16.7<\/a>. There have been no major changes since last month, mostly just a series of bugfixes on the Copper theme and minor usability improvements.<\/p>\n<h1 id=\"coming-soon\"><a href=\"#coming-soon\" id=\"coming-soon\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Coming Soon<\/h1>\n<h2 id=\"new-docs\"><a href=\"#new-docs\" id=\"new-docs\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>New Docs<\/h2>\n<p>Orchid's docs are getting a reboot! When I started work on Orchid, Bootstrap was the only CSS framework I knew of. I had no idea there were so many great options out there, and ultimately I have come to really enjoy Bulma for its simplicity and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>And so, I've been building the &quot;Copper&quot; theme, based on Bulma, to serve as the home for all of Orchid's own documentation, and also of its supplemental libraries. Here's a preview:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://orchid.run/\"><img src=\"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/svynj5ko32iwvpgfuuo4.png\" alt=\"New Docs\" /><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Also coming with the new theme will be a major overhaul in the <em>content<\/em> on the docs site, as I continue to iterate upon the docs and figure out the best way to present the information to you.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"more-integrations\"><a href=\"#more-integrations\" id=\"more-integrations\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>More Integrations<\/h2>\n<p>From the very beginning, Orchid was created to be infinitely flexible, able to work with a wide variety of different systems and content structures, but until now it has been fairly closely tied to just Netlify and GitHub. I myself regularly use Microsft Azure and BitBucket at work and want to use Orchid in those places, and I can imagine y'all do as well.<\/p>\n<p>So work is currently under way to make it easier to integrate Orchid into those different Git platforms, so you do not need to change your current processes to fully utilize Orchid's power! Soon, you'll be able to use the native Wikis on Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, and Azure DevOps as a headless CMS, and you'll also be able to deploy directly to their static hosting platforms and create releases!<\/p>\n<h1 id=\"get-involved\"><a href=\"#get-involved\" id=\"get-involved\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Get Involved<\/h1>\n<p>You don't have to be an expert in Java, Kotlin, Orchid, or anything else to help out the Orchid project.

And it's all thanks to this wonderful community of\nindividuals believing in a better way to do documentation, so thank you all!<\/p>\n<p>The holidays were fairly quiet in terms of new releases and contributions, but <a href=\"https://github.com/tomb50\">Tom Beadman<\/a>\nhelped immensely with improving the asciidoctor integration. A small PR with huge impact for improving the\nquality-of-life for Asciidoctor fans, which now includes support for <code>include::[]<\/code> macros!<\/p>\n<p>I also merged work <a href=\"https://github.com/DanySK\">Danilo Pianini<\/a> had done for improving the YouTube tag to support\naspect-ratios instead of fixed sized.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\"><a href=\"#whats-new\" id=\"whats-new\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>What's New?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that 0.18.0 is released, I've been able to work on some smaller features I've been wanting to support for a while. I\nhad to restrain myself from working on them for 0.18.0 to prevent feature-creep, but it's been nice finally getting to\nadd the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://orchid.run/plugins/orchid-bible-feature\">orchid-bible-feature<\/a> plugin has been broken for some time, as the APIs driving it had been decommissioned.\nI have removed the previously-broken <code>bible()<\/code> function, which pre-rendered Bible verses, and replaced it with a new\n<a href=\"https://faithlife.com/products/reftagger\">Faithlife Reftagger<\/a> meta-component, which will automatically create\npopups for all Bible verses it finds on the page!<\/li>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid\">Mermaid JS<\/a> markup has been added to the\n<a href=\"https://orchid.run/plugins/orchid-diagrams-feature\">orchid-diagrams-feature<\/a> plugin. As Mermaid is a javascript library, support is added through a meta-component\ninstead of using pre-rendered markup like PlantUML.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>youtube<\/code> template tag in <a href=\"https://orchid.run/plugins/orchid-writers-blocks-feature\">orchid-writers-blocks-feature<\/a> can now display videos of a given aspect-ratio,\nmaking them better-suited for responsive designs.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://orchid.run/plugins/orchid-changelog-feature\">orchid-changelog-feature<\/a> now supports single-file changelogs, such as the\n<a href=\"https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\">Keep A Changelog format<\/a> format.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 id=\"in-progress\"><a href=\"#in-progress\" id=\"in-progress\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>In Progress<\/h1>\n<p>Supporting include macros for Asciidoctor was a huge step forward, but there's still work to be done to improve that\nintegration, and you can expect more Asciidoctor improvements in the coming weeks, with <code>image::[]<\/code> being the next\ntarget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to a few more quality-of-life improvements planned for the near-future, I've begun work on a new\n<code>orchid-snippets-feature<\/code> plugin!
