- Changes standard ordering of collection search params to ['itemId', 'collectionType', 'collectionId'], which is more 
    natural to think about and better matches the order in which the params would be needed.
- Adds changelog publisher to require a changelog entry for publishing.
- Orchid now exits with a failure status code when the `deploy` task deployment fails for any reason.
