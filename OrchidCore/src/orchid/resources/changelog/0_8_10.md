**New Features**

- New Breadcrumbs API
- New Menu Item types
    - `pageIds` in Pages plugin
- Helpful Kotlin extensions for registering types in `OrchidModule` and for resolving objects or sets from 
    `OrchidContext`. 

**Bugfixes**

- Manually specifies UTF-8 rather than relying on `Charset.defaultCharset()`
- Overall improvements to Javadoc templates

**Breaking Changes**

- Wiki no longer adds section meus by default. You can easily add them to all Wiki pages if desired in the 
    `wikiPages.menu` archetype.
- `OrchidCollection.find` now returns a `Stream<T>` instead of a `List<T>`. Its base class constructors have also been
    changed so that a Generator is now no longer necessary.
