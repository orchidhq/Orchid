- Adds publish and expiry dates, which are used to check for time-based draft status.
- Runs `orchidBuild` task on subprojects with no Java source, so that we still have all subprojects generating Orchid 
    documentation.

- Deep-merges config, environment-specific config, and datafiles.
- Adds injectable template globals.
- Improves user manual documentation.
