- ConfigArchetype now broadcasts an event so we can configure an item through code as well as in `config.yml`
- Set config archetypes so they are all namespaced under their Generator's key, making it less likely to have options
    collisions, and also makes it easier to pull all information relevant to a plugin into a single `data/` file
